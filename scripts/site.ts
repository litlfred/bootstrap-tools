/**
 * Stage an instance's site for GitHub Pages: its files as they sit, the
 * one-page book of its READMEs as the index, and — for bootstrap — its own
 * Knowledge Graph at the address its `@id` names.
 *
 * @module bootstrap-tools/scripts/site
 * @covers code
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-30: *"https://litlfred.github.io/bootstrap is 404"*. The
 * pieces existed (`publish-files.ts`, `export-graph.ts`) and nothing ran them
 * where bootstrap lives on its own. This is the one command a Pages workflow
 * runs; the workflow then hands the staged directory to
 * `actions/jekyll-build-pages`, which renders every `.md` to `.html` and
 * rewrites `.md` links to match — so this toolset still carries no Markdown
 * renderer (`check-closure.ts`).
 *
 * What lands in `--out`, in the order it is written — first writer wins,
 * because nothing already in `--out` is overwritten (`publish-files.ts`):
 *
 * 1. for bootstrap only, its graph (`export-graph.ts`) at
 *    `<base-url>bootstrap.jsonld`, and its `.json` copy at `bootstrap.json`.
 *    That copy shares its address with the declaration, and the graph keeps
 *    it, as `bootstrap-graph-publication` says and as the harness's own site
 *    build does (`--allow-collision bootstrap.json`). The declaration is still
 *    served, at `<version>/bootstrap.json`, and the skip is reported;
 * 1a. its NAMED SUBGRAPHS (`subgraph-jsonld.ts`), framed from that same graph:
 *    `subgraph/index.jsonld` (the repository), `subgraph/<name>/index.jsonld`
 *    (the instance) and, for each directory of a kind the graph reads,
 *    `subgraph/<name>/<path>/index.jsonld` and `index.hydrated.jsonld`, with
 *    the one context they name at `subgraph/v<major>/context.jsonld`. For bootstrap,
 *    and for any instance that `needs` bootstrap — whose graph is written in
 *    bootstrap's classes, so it is built with bootstrap's checkout beside it
 *    and is a problem, never silently absent, when that checkout is not
 *    there. Such an instance's graph document is written too, at
 *    `<name>.jsonld`, because every member's `@id` is a fragment of it. The
 *    publication root is `--base-url`, else `iriBase`, else the declaration's
 *    GitHub Pages address;
 * 2. every DOCUMENT the instance publishes at the address it names — each
 *    JSON Schema's `$id` and each JSON-LD document's `@id` under `iriBase`
 *    ({@link publishedDocuments}). An `@id` with no extension (`…/0.1.0/ns`,
 *    the namespace a vocabulary is) gets the document at that extensionless
 *    path, as the harness's build copies `processes/ns.jsonld` to
 *    `processes/ns`; every `.jsonld` also gets a `.json` copy, because Pages
 *    serves `.jsonld` as a download and `.json` as JSON. The `.jsonld` stays
 *    the real one;
 * 3. every file of the instance, as it sits (`publish-files.ts`), so every
 *    relative link in them still resolves — and again under `<version>/`,
 *    because an IRI a program reads is `<iriBase><version>/…`;
 * 3a. `README.md`, the book (`readme-book.ts`), with its links checked,
 *    ending in a "Published documents" section that links every address
 *    above — rendered at `<root>/README.html`. Written BEFORE the files, so it
 *    takes the root README's place: the book opens with that README;
 * 4. `index.html`, a redirect to `README.html` — the DEFAULT landing page,
 *    and only that (owner, 2026-10-01: *"the harness landing page at
 *    …/index.html is a redirect to the README.html. Will make it easier for
 *    harnesses to change landing page behaviour"*). To change it, an
 *    instance (or the harness staging it) puts its own `index.html` or
 *    `index.md` at its root: that file is staged as it sits and the redirect
 *    is not written, reported as skipped. A file rather than a declaration
 *    field, because it is what Pages itself serves first and what anybody
 *    looking at the branch would look for;
 * 5. `_config.yml`, when the instance has none: the title, the theme, and a
 *    `defaults:` entry per page saying what its footer links to; and
 *    `_layouts/default.html` (`templates/site/default.html`), the theme's
 *    layout with that footer. The theme's own footer links GitHub's editor
 *    for the file on `gh-pages` — a staged copy — and for a generated page
 *    any edit is overwritten (owner, 2026-10-01: *"footer should not take
 *    them to edit page when bootstrap-tools used"*). A generated page's
 *    footer names bootstrap-tools, the script, and its source; an authored
 *    page's links the editor for its SOURCE on the instance's branch.
 *
 * Every `@context` bootstrap writes is inline in its document (measured
 * 2026-09-30: no file names an external context), so publishing each document
 * publishes its context. The one exception is built, not authored: every
 * named-subgraph file names `subgraph/v<major>/context.jsonld` by URL, and it is
 * staged with them.
 *
 * `--check` stages into a temporary directory, lists every document address
 * and fails on any problem: an address nothing is staged at, a link on the
 * README page that would not land, an address taken by a different file.
 *
 * `--subgraph <id>` (repeatable) renders only the named Subgraphs — the
 * directories the declaration lists under those ids — plus the files at the
 * instance root (its declaration, README and assets), which say what the
 * Subgraphs are part of. Absent, the whole Knowledge Graph is rendered. An id
 * the declaration does not list is a problem, never silently an empty site
 * (`processes/render-kg-to-github-pages.bpmn`, the process this is a step of).
 *
 * Usage: bun run bootstrap-tools/scripts/site.ts --root ../bootstrap (--out ../_site-src | --check) [--base-url <url>] [--subgraph <id>]… [--provenance] [--branch <source branch, default main>] [--bootstrap <dir>]
