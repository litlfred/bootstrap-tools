/**
 * The OUTPUT of rendering a Knowledge Graph to GitHub Pages: the status of the
 * push, and one message that carries the deployed commit and the QA result.
 *
 * @module bootstrap-tools/scripts/pages-status
 * @covers code
 *
 * The last step of `processes/render-kg-to-github-pages.bpmn` (skill
 * `render-kg-to-github-pages`). The other steps already had their tools —
 * `site.ts` stages, `readme-book.ts --check` checks the page, the Pages
 * workflow commits the site onto `gh-pages`, `init.ts` checks the address —
 * and nothing said, in ONE answer a caller can act on, whether the push
 * landed. This is that answer, and it runs nothing new: it stages with
 * `stageSite` (the QA of what was pushed), asks the publication root URL and
 * each document address with `httpAnswer` (the QA of what is served), and
 * names the commit.
 *
 * ## Three states, never two
 *
 * - `pushed` — the staged tree has no problem, the root URL answers, and
 *   every document address answers;
 * - `not-pushed` — something checked and failed: a staging problem (so
 *   nothing should have been pushed), the root URL or a document address
 *   answering 404;
 * - `could-not-determine` — nothing failed, but an answer came back about the
 *   way HERE rather than about the site (403, 407, 5xx, no network). Never
 *   rendered as `pushed`: a check that could not look is not a pass.
 *
 * ## The message
 *
 * One line a caller can post as it stands — on a pull request, in a log, to
 * the person who asked:
 *
 * `pushed 1a2b3c4 to https://owner.github.io/repo/ — QA: staged ok (120 files, 7 documents); root 200; documents 7/7 answer`
 *
 * The commit is the one the site was built from: `--sha`, or the root's
 * `HEAD`. A site here is served from the `gh-pages` BRANCH, so pass the
 * commit on that branch — the answer to "which bytes are live".
 *
 * Exit status: 0 `pushed`, 1 `not-pushed`, 3 `could-not-determine`, 2 no
 * declaration and no `--url` — there is no address to ask.
 *
 * Usage: bun run bootstrap-tools/scripts/pages-status.ts --root <instance> [--url <publication root>] [--sha <commit>] [--subgraph <id>]… [--offline] [--json]
