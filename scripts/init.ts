/**
 * Walk an instance's initialization steps AS ITS DECLARATIONS NAME THEM,
 * check each, perform the ones a tool can perform, and report every step in
 * one of four states — never a green tick over something nobody checked.
 *
 * @module bootstrap-tools/scripts/init
 * @covers code
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-30: *"bootstrap tools on init should create ghpages if tools
 * available"*, and *"then dispatch agent to try to make sure all initialize
 * steps are done … to try to move through initialization steps as named by
 * the harness(es)"*. This is the tool half. The process half is bootstrap's
 * `processes/complete-initialization.bpmn`, with the skills
 * `initialization-steps` and `publish-site`: an agent following it may run
 * this command where tools are available, and does the same steps by reading
 * files where they are not.
 *
 * ## Where the steps come from
 *
 * Nothing here is a per-instance list. The steps are read off the
 * declaration at `--root` and the declarations it `needs`, each found as a
 * sibling checkout `../<name>/<name>.json`:
 *
 * | step | named by | a tool performs it? |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `declaration` | the file itself: `<name>.json` parses | no |
 * | `needs:<name>` | `needs` — the dependency is beside it, and parses | no |
 * | `instructions:<name>` | FR-4 — `<name>/docs/bootstrap/initialization.md`, when the dependency has one | no: *stated* |
 * | `schemas:staged` | each JSON Schema `$id` and JSON-LD `@id` under `iriBase` — PRIMARY | checked: the site stages each at its IRI |
 * | `schemas:published` | the same IRIs — PRIMARY | no: the Pages workflow publishes them; this checks they answer |
 * | `directory:<id>` | `directories[]` — the path exists | no |
 * | `asset:<id>` | `assets[]` — the file exists | no |
 * | `readme` | FR-8 — the root has a `README.md` | no |
 * | `readme-sections` | the README's own markers — every opted-in section is current | yes |
 * | `site:workflow` | `repository` — a workflow commits the site onto gh-pages: the instance's own, or one in this toolset that checks it out | no |
 * | `site:branch` | `repository` — a gh-pages branch exists (2026-10-01: it must, before Pages can be on) | no: says how |
 * | `site:enabled` | `repository` — Pages is on, serving gh-pages | yes, with `gh`, once the branch exists |
 * | `site:live` | `iriBase`, else the Pages address — the address answers, and so does its `README.html` | no |
 *
 * The two `schemas:` steps come first after the declarations are read, and
 * lead the printed summary: owner, 2026-09-30, *"json(ld) is primary step in
 * initializing KG harness"*. The site is the vehicle, the documents at their
 * addresses the goal. A 404 is `not-done`; a 403, 407, 5xx or no answer is
 * `could-not-determine` ({@link httpAnswer}).
 *
 * A directory is NOT created for you: an empty directory is not tracked by
 * git, so creating one would satisfy this check on one machine and nowhere
 * else. It is reported with what to put in it.
 *
 * ## Four states, and why four
 *
 * - `done` — checked, and it holds (possibly because this run just did it);
 * - `not-done` — checked, and it does not; `action` says what to do;
 * - `could-not-determine` — the check could not run (no `gh`, no network).
 *   Never reported as done: a check that could not look is not a pass;
 * - `stated` — the declarations name it but nothing can observe it (reading
 *   and following a harness's instructions), exactly as a `stated`
 *   precondition in bootstrap's diagrams is never reported as satisfied.
 *
 * Exit status: 0 when every checkable step is done; 1 when any is not done;
 * 3 when none is not-done but some could not be determined; 2 when there is
 * no declaration to read.
 *
 * NEVER enables anything that costs money: Pages on a public repository and
 * the Actions minutes it uses are free, and nothing else is touched.
 *
 * Usage: bun run bootstrap-tools/scripts/init.ts [--root ../bootstrap] [--dry-run] [--offline] [--json]
