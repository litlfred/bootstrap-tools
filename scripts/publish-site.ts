/**
 * Publish a staged site onto a branch (default `gh-pages`) as a FULL REPLACE.
 *
 * @module scripts/publish-site
 *
 * Owner, 2026-10-04 (bootstrap-tools#7): "dont want tight/exclusive github
 * Tools … can we also support agentic workflow". Until now this step was an
 * inline shell loop inside `.github/workflows/pages.yml`, so only a GitHub
 * runner could publish. It is now the same command for every runner — an
 * agent, a person at a terminal, or a CI job:
 *
 *   bun run bootstrap-tools/scripts/site.ts --root . --out _site-src
 *   bun run bootstrap-tools/scripts/publish-site.ts --site _site-src --remote <git url>
 *
 * Nothing here is GitHub-specific: `--remote` is any git URL the caller can
 * push to, with whatever credentials that caller already has (a token in the
 * URL in CI, the user's own git credentials locally). Serving the branch —
 * GitHub Pages, or any static host that reads a branch — is the host's job.
 *
 * Rebuild, never rebase: each attempt clones the branch fresh, replaces every
 * tracked file with the staged site, and pushes.
 *
 * Two narrower replaces, for a branch that holds more than one site (owner,
 * 2026-10-10: staging previews are agent-run, bean n3h9):
 *
 *   --into STAGING/<branch>   replace ONLY that subtree; everything else on the
 *                             branch stays (a preview never touches the root)
 *   --keep STAGING --keep branches
 *                             a full replace that keeps these top-level paths
 *                             (the root publish never deletes the previews) A push that loses a race is
 * retried from a fresh clone (3 attempts), so a concurrent publisher's commit
 * is never merged into ours or overwritten by a force push.
